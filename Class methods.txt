Classes:
Driver
	Main
JsonHandler
	jsonToShipment(json) //takes a json file and converts it to a LinkedList of shipments
	warehouseToJson(LinkedList) //takes a LinkedList of a single warehouse's shipments and converts them to a json file
Shipment
	shipment data
	Shipment(shipmentID,weight,etc...) //On creation of shipment
	getters
	setters
Warehouse
	string warehouseID
	boolean shipmentReceipt
	LinkedList shipmentList
	Warehouse(warehouseID) //On creation of warehouse
	addShipment(shipment data)
	getShipmentLinkedList()
	getReceipt()
	setReceipt()
WarehouseHandler
	LinkedList warehouseList
	getWarehouseShipments(warehouseID) //returns a LinkedList of shipments given a specific warehouse ID
	getWarehouse(warehouseID) //returns a warehouse object given a warehouse ID, returns null if doesn't exist
	createWarehouse(warehouseID) //creates a warehouse given a warehouse ID
	getWarehouseReceipt(warehouseID) //returns a boolean given a warehouse ID
	setWarehouseReceipt(warehouseID, input) //sets a boolean for a warehouse given a warehouse ID, if the warehouse doesn't exist it creates one.
InputHandler
	getInput() //gets input from the console and calls the relevant methods
	changeWarehouseReceipt() //changes a boolean
	addJsonFile() //adds a json file given a filepath
	outputShipmentList() //takes a file
FileOperations
	getFile()
	setFile()

- Order of Operations -
1. 'warehouse (warehouseID) enable freight receipt'/'warehouse (warehouseID) end freight receipt'
User requests to set a warehouse Receipt
InputHandler sends the request to WarehouseHandler
If the warehouse doesn't exist, tell the user to create one or input a json file
If the warehouse does exist, WarehouseController sets its receipt
- End -

2. 'import shipments'
User requests to add a json file
InputHandler sends the request to FileOperations, which allows the user to select a json file
FileOperations sends the json file to JsonHandler
JsonHandler sends a LinkedList of shipments to the Driver
The Driver creates the shipments using the LinkedList
The shipments add themselves to their warehouses, if a warehouse doesn't exist it is created
if a warehouse is created, it sends itself to WarehouseController to add to the LinkedList of warehouses
- End -

3. 'export warehouse (warehouseID) shipments'
User requests a specific warehouse's shipments
InputHandler sends the request to WarehouseController
WarehouseController gets the specific warehouse's LinkedList and sends it to JsonHandler
JsonHandler converts the LinkedList into a Json file and sends the file to FileOperations
FileOperations creates the file on the computer
- End -

4. 'export all shipments'
User requests all warehouse shipments
InputHandler sends the request to WarehouseController
WarehouseController gets all the warehouse's LinkedLists and sends a single list to JsonHandler
JsonHandler converts the LinkedList into a Json file and sends the file to FileOperations
FileOperations creates the file on the computer
- End -

5. 'create warehouse (warehouseID)'
User requests to create a warehouse
InputHandler sends the request to WarehouseHandler
WarehouseController creates a warehouse
- End -

6. 'add incoming shipment (warehouseID),(shipmentID),(shipmentMethod),(weight),(receiptDate)'
User requests to add a single shipment
InputHandler sends the request to WarehouseHandler
WarehouseHandler sends the request to the specific warehouse
- End -
