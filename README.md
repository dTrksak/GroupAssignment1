All the classes go in the Project Folder, I have already created each class in java to get us going.
The FileOperations class is already completed, if there are any problems with it or it needs more methods feel free to fix them or contact me.

I'll be starting testing tonight.

Just so you know, I did a round of testing and updated the classes. The only thing that doesn't work (as far as I know) is importing a json file. The problem was related to what the json was imported as, since it isn't imported as a list of objects, its imported as a single object.
